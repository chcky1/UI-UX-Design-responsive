ABOUT THE PROJECT : In this project, I created a responsive webpage about nature travel spots in India. I focused mainly on hills and waterfalls. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make this webpage and executed the code using Visual Studio Code. My goal was to make a webpage that works well on both desktop and mobile screens so that anyone can view it easily without any problems.When someone visits the webpage, they first see a header at the top that says “Explore Nature Travel Spots in India”. This tells the user clearly what the website is about. Below the header, there is a navigation bar. On the left side of this bar, there is the website name, NatureIndia. On the right side, there are links to different sections of the webpage, like hills, waterfalls, temples, restaurants, and famous foods. These links help users quickly go to the part of the webpage they are interested in.I also made sure that this navigation bar works well on mobile. On smaller screens, the navigation links are hidden, and a burger menu icon appears. When the user clicks or taps on this burger icon, the links appear in a neat vertical list. I did this by writing JavaScript that adds or removes an active class when the burger icon is clicked. I also used media queries in CSS to change the layout for smaller screen sizes.In the main part of the webpage, I wrote about different travel spots in India. The first section is about hills. I included places like Shimla, Manali, Coorg, Wayanad Hills, and Kannur Hills. I wrote short descriptions for each hill station so that users can know what is special about them. The next section is about waterfalls. I mentioned Jog Falls in Karnataka, Dudhsagar Falls in Goa, Chitrakoot Falls in Chhattisgarh, Meenmutty Falls and Kanthanpara Falls in Wayanad, and Aralam Waterfalls in Kannur. Each waterfall has a short description telling why it is worth visiting.After waterfalls, I wrote about temples. I included Tirupati Balaji in Andhra Pradesh, Vaishno Devi in Jammu and Kashmir, and Meenakshi Temple in Tamil Nadu. These are some of the most famous temples in India, and many people visit them for peace and blessings.Then I added a section about restaurants near these places. I listed some popular restaurants in Kannur, Wayanad, Coorg, Manali, and Shimla. For example, in Coorg, there are restaurants like Coorg Cuisine and Raintree Restaurant, which are famous for their traditional Coorgi food. In Manali, there are Johnson’s Cafe and Cafe 1947, which are popular with travellers.Finally, I wrote about the famous foods of different parts of India. I mentioned food like butter chicken and chole bhature from North India, dosa and idli from South India, rasgulla and fish curry from East India, dhokla and pav bhaji from West India, and poha and dal bafla from Central India. This section helps people know what food to try when they visit these places.I kept the design simple with clear headings and easy navigation. I used CSS to give it a clean and fresh look with good colours that suit nature themes. The footer has my name to give credit for the work done. Through this project, I learnt how to make a website responsive and how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to create an interactive and user-friendly webpage that looks good on all devices.
